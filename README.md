The dataset contains 43,400 entries with 12 columns. Key columns include:

age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, and bmi: These are potential numerical predictors for stroke.
gender, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, and smoking_status: Categorical features that may also contribute.
stroke: Target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of stroke.
There are some missing values in the bmi and smoking_status columns, which we’ll handle during data preprocessing. Let’s proceed with the following steps:

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical features).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a model.
Evaluate the model.
Visualize important insights from the data and model
